# Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) Exploration

This exercise explores Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as part of the Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900) learning path.

## Services Implemented

- Azure Cosmos DB account (NoSQL API)
- Sample database and container creation
- JSON document creation and modification
- SQL-like querying of JSON data

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Cosmos DB account provisioning
- Provisioned throughput configuration
- JSON-based document storage
- Automatic system metadata properties
- SQL-style querying using the NoSQL API

## Engineering Relevance

This lab demonstrates how Azure Cosmos DB supports:

- Schema-flexible document storage
- Globally scalable NoSQL workloads
- Low-latency application data
- JSON-based data modeling

Cosmos DB is commonly used for distributed applications, microservices architectures, and high-scale transactional systems.
