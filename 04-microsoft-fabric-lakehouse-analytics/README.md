# Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse Analytics

This exercise explores data ingestion and analytics using a Lakehouse architecture in Microsoft Fabric as part of the Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900) learning path.

## Components Implemented

- Fabric Workspace 
- Lakehouse creation
- Data ingestion using Data Pipeline (Copy activity)
- Managed Delta table creation
- SQL-based analytics using SQL endpoint

## Dataset Used

NYC Taxi – Green dataset  
(~75+ million rows, ~2.5 GB of data)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Workspace as asset boundary
- Lakehouse architecture (Files + Delta Tables)
- Pipeline-based ingestion (no-code data movement)
- Managed Delta Lake tables
- SQL analytics endpoint
- Aggregation queries on large-scale datasets

## Engineering Relevance

This lab demonstrates how modern lakehouse platforms combine:

- Data engineering (pipelines)
- Storage (OneLake)
- Delta Lake table management
- SQL-based analytics

This architecture mirrors production analytics platforms built on Spark and Delta Lake.
