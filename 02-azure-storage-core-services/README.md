# Azure Storage Core Services

This project explores core Azure Storage services as part of the Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900) learning path.

## What This Project Covers

- Provisioning an Azure Storage Account
- Blob Storage (flat namespace)
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (hierarchical namespace)
- Azure Files (SMB-based cloud file shares)
- Azure Tables (NoSQL key-value storage)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Storage account configuration (LRS, Standard tier)
- Virtual folders vs hierarchical namespace
- Enabling Data Lake Gen2 upgrade
- File share provisioning and connectivity
- PartitionKey and RowKey design in Table Storage
- Schema flexibility in NoSQL systems

## Why This Matters

Understanding Azure Storage is foundational for:
- Data engineering pipelines
- Data lake architectures
- Scalable NoSQL workloads
- Secure cloud data platform design

This lab builds practical knowledge of storing and organizing non-relational data in Azure.
