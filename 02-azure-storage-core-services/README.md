# Azure Storage Core Services

This exercise explores core Azure Storage services as part of the Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900) learning path.

## Services Explored

- Azure Blob Storage (flat namespace)
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (hierarchical namespace)
- Azure Files
- Azure Tables (NoSQL key-value store)

## Key Concepts

- Storage account provisioning (Standard, LRS)
- Virtual folders vs hierarchical namespace
- Data Lake Gen2 upgrade
- SMB-based file shares
- PartitionKey and RowKey design
- Schema flexibility in NoSQL systems

## Engineering Relevance

This lab demonstrates how Azure Storage supports:

- Object storage for analytics pipelines
- Data lake architectures
- Hybrid file workloads
- Scalable NoSQL storage patterns

Understanding these services is foundational for cloud-based data engineering.
